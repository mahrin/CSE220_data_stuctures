# ðŸ“˜ CSE220: Data Structures  

As a Senior Lecturer at BRAC University, Bangladesh, I teach CSE220: Data Structures to sophomore undergraduate Computer Science students.

These lecture files are adapted from my undergraduate and masterâ€™s courses, as well as my teaching assistantship experience. They are enriched with simple examples and analogies to make complex topicsâ€”such as linked lists, trees, and graphsâ€”easier to visualize and understand.

The course covers core data structures, including arrays, linked lists, hashing, stack, queue, trees, heaps, and graphs, along with selected algorithmic concepts such as complexity analysis and graph traversals. Together, these provide students with a solid foundation for advanced algorithm courses.

- **00:** Array Basics & Operations (1D)  
- **L01:** Introduction to Complexity Theory
